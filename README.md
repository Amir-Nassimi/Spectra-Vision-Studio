## Introduction

Welcome to the Image Super Spectra Vision, a state-of-the-art platform engineered to transform image resolution through
innovative super-resolution technologies. This system is not just a tool; it's a gateway to unlocking unseen details in
images ranging from everyday photography to specialized fields like medical imaging and geospatial analysis. Our
sophisticated approach, including the renowned ESRGAN model and our proprietary MultipleSR model, ensures unparalleled
image clarity and detail. Dive into the world of high-fidelity imaging with our comprehensive guide covering everything
from setup to execution.

## Features

### Advanced ESRGAN-based Super-Resolution

1. **High-Fidelity ESRGAN Model:** Our system employs the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (
   ESRGAN), renowned for its ability to upscale images with exceptional quality.
2. **Quadruple Magnification Capability:** Experience a new level of detail with a magnification power of up to 4X,
   making every pixel count in the journey from blur to clarity.
3. **Broad Spectrum Application:** From professional photographers to scientific researchers, our ESRGAN implementation
   is versatile enough to cater to a vast array of image enhancement needs.

### Customizable MultipleSR Model

1. **Tailored Super-Resolution:** The MultipleSR model is our answer to diverse magnification requirements,
   custom-trained to handle various scales with precision.
2. **Dynamic Model Adaptation:** Seamlessly switch between different magnifications and models, thanks to our dynamic
   loading feature, catering to specific image requirements.
3. **Extendable Framework:** The MultipleSR model sets the stage for continuous innovation, allowing for the integration
   of future advancements in super-resolution technology.

## Installation

Embark on your journey to superior image resolution by following these simple installation steps:

1. **Environment Setup:**
    - Initiate your venture with Python 3.9 in a virtual environment, ensuring a clean and controlled setting.
    - Forge your path by creating a 'Models' directory at the root.

2. **Model Acquisition:**
    - Access our curated collection of
      models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xqpAl0RXVSifARC7flcH_TUfphMj1j1w?usp=sharing) using the
      passphrase: `Super_Spectra_Vision`.
    - Unearth the models and station them in your newly created 'Models' directory.

3. **Dependency Installation:**
    - Install the necessary dependencies to empower your system with the command:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

## Usage

Elevate your images to new heights with a simple command:

```bash
python super_resolution_app.py [model; e.g. EDSR] [available size; e.g. 4] [path/to/your/image.jpg]
```

Choose from an array of models to best suit your image enhancement needs:

| Model  | Available Sizes |
|--------|-----------------|
| EDSR   | 2, 3, 4         |
| ESPCN  | 2, 3, 4         |
| FSRCNN | 2, 3, 4         |
| LapSRN | 2, 4, 8         |
| ESRGAN | 4               |
