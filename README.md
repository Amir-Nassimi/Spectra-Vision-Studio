   loading feature, catering to specific image requirements.
3. **Extendable Framework:** The MultipleSR model sets the stage for continuous innovation, allowing for the integration
   of future advancements in super-resolution technology.

## Installation

Embark on your journey to superior image resolution by following these simple installation steps:

1. **Environment Setup:**
    - Initiate your venture with Python 3.9 in a virtual environment, ensuring a clean and controlled setting.
    - Forge your path by creating a 'Models' directory at the root.

2. **Model Acquisition:**
    - Access our curated collection of
      models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xqpAl0RXVSifARC7flcH_TUfphMj1j1w?usp=sharing) using the
      passphrase: `Super_Spectra_Vision`.
    - Unearth the models and station them in your newly created 'Models' directory.

3. **Dependency Installation:**
    - Install the necessary dependencies to empower your system with the command:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

## Usage

Using Super Spectra Vision is straightforward. Follow these steps to generate high quality images:

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory where Lingua Luxe Vision is installed.

2. **Run the script using Python and provide the necessary arguments:** the model name, magnification factor, and the
   path to the image. For example:

   ```bash
   python super_resolution_app.py --model_name --magnification --image_path
   ```
    - `--model_name`: Place your chosen model.
    - `--magnification`: Place 4 your chosen magnification factor.
    - `--image_path`: Place path/to/your/image.jpg with the actual path to your image.

   For example, to generate an image using the detailed model with specific magnification, your command might look like
   this:

   ```bash
   python super_resolution_app.py EDSR 4 path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```

3. **Understanding the Script's Output:**

The script will validate the model and magnification factor based on the provided compatibility table:

<style>
  .custom-row {
    background-color: #c2c2c2;
    color: #000000;
    font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
  }
</style>

<table align="center">
   <tr class="custom-row">
      <td colspan="1" align="center">
         <h4>Model</h4>
      </td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center">
         <h4>Available Size</h4>
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td colspan="1" align="center">EDSR</td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center">2, 3, 4</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td colspan="1" align="center">ESPCN</td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center">2, 3, 4</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td colspan="1" align="center">FSRCNN</td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center">2, 3, 4</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td colspan="1" align="center">LapSRN</td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center">2, 4, 8</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td colspan="1" align="center">ESRGAN</td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center">4</td>
   </tr>
</table>


---
If the combination is valid, it will proceed to enhance the resolution of the provided image using the ImageSR class.
The enhanced image will be displayed on your screen if the process is successful. If you enter an invalid model or
magnification factor (one that's not compatible according to your
table), the script will raise an error and terminate.
